I am a high-school student, planning to enter the field of Computer Science in post-secondary and beyond.

I am an executive of the VEX Robotics Club, the Computer Science Club, and an advisor for my school on 3D Printing.

My interests include Linux, programming, information security, and physics.

I am currently learning Go and Rust in my free time, as well as developing a few applications for my community.
