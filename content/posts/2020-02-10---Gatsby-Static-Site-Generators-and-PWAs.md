I recently started looking into PWAs for a site I was developing, and once again noticed Gatsby. After looking into it, I found that it met all of my requirements, while providing significant benefits in workflow and performance over traditional static site generators.

I first heard about Gatsby when looking into static site generators about a year ago, but decided that Hugo, a similar service that generates pure HTML, was more up my alley. This was before I found out about PWAs and how using Javascript in some cases can actually increase performance.

Fast-forward a year, after I had done some more React development, and gained some more experience with web app development. React's componentisation of HTML was a gamechanger for me, and I had started using it in some of my personal projects as well.
