You may have noticed that this site still looks bare, even in comparison to my last personal site. I'm still in the progress of porting over information from the previous blog, built with Hugo (which is still an amazing tool!) 

I'm also working on a post about my experiences working with Gatsby, and what else I hope to learn from it. If I have time, I also plan to post some of my thoughts on learning Go and Rust at some point in the future. 

My privacy detox is still ongoing, but it will definitely be a while before I post another update (I never realized how much of a plague Instagram was until I deleted it)

School's been pretty busy, and I most likely won't have much time to write more content until after May (AP tests woo...), but I hope to write some more over the summer.
